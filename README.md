I see you've onboarded my [Journey](https://vidhi-mody.github.io/) of trying to learn something new everyday, figuring out the whys, *'coding under the influence of caffeine'*, debugging, executing and staying current in the technology arena with one final destination to be the **"Queen of Codes"**

My career is developing software, but my life is adventuring. I am a curious person who enjoys figuring out the building blocks of the world, and rearranging them to build something even better. ¯\ (ツ) /¯
