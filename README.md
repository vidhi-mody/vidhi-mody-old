"When you play the **Game of Codes**, you execute or you fail. There is no middle ground."

```cpp
while (success!=true) {
   keepMovingForward(); 
   }

Hey! I'm Vidhi. I see you've onboarded my [Journey](https://vidhi-mody.github.io/) of trying to learn something new everyday, figuring out the whys, *'coding under the influence of caffeine'*, debugging, executing and staying current in the technology arena with one final destination to be the "Queen of Codes"

My career is developing software, but my life is adventuring. I am a curious person who enjoys figuring out the building blocks of the world, and rearranging them to build something even better. ¯\ (ツ) /¯
